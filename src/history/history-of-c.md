# History of C

The C language was developed in the early 1970s by researchers at Bell Labs (then owned by AT&T, a major American Telecommunications company) to implement the Unix Operating System, a precursor to Linux, Mac OS, and other operating systems like FreeBSD.

C has a few characteristics that make it well suited to writing Systems software (software that runs other software).

It isn't written in assembly, which makes C portable between different operating systems.

It compiles to asssembly, which makes C fast.

C allows the programmer to directly control memory, which lets the programmer manage resources that are outside of the C program easily.

C is one of the most influential programming languages of its time. It compiles to assembly, which makes it fast and highly portable -- It forms the basis of Operating Systems like Linux, Mac OS, Windows, and others like BSD.

Because of these characteristics, and the rise of Unix based Operating Systems (the BSDs), C underwent a standardization effort to establish a standard for the C language. The first published standard was in 1989, informally called C89 or ANSI C. There are a few more standards, C99 (ratified in 1999), C11 (ratified in 2011), C18 (ratified in 2018) and C2x (A future standard for C). Some people also refer to the C language used in the C programming language as K&R C named after its authors, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
