# C++ and its Uses

C++ is an exceptionally good language to learn if you want to delve deeper into how the computer works. C++ is popular for system programming, which is software that other software runs on -- some examples of this are games, graphic rendering software, web browsers, operating systems, embedded systems, database systems, compilers, networking systems, and algorithmic computing.

C++ is also portable (as long as you have a compiler that emits code for your OS + Architecture, you can run it), with frequent updates to the language (now every three years.)

C++ has endured as a popular language for more than four decades now, with no signs of stopping -- you can find C++ code almost anywhere you look. With its high performance and convenient set of features, it is a boon in productivity compared to regular C and a useful language to learn.
