# History of C++

C++'s history intersects quite a bit with C's history. C++ was also developed at Bell Labs, by a researcher named Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979. C lacks native object orientation, which Bjarne believed would aid programmers in creating larger software programs, and so he set out to create a language that would be similar to C but with added features to increase the safety and ease of use of the language.

Because of this, C++ shares most of the same characteristics as C, with a few differences:

- C++ has strong typing (whereas C is weakly typed).
- C++ has features that faciliate object orientation.
- C++ has a wider standard library, including the Standard Template Library (STL), which contains a set of containers and algorithms which operate on those containers.
- C++ has extra features, including but not limited to:
  - Exceptions
  - Generics
  - Virtual Functions
  - Type Inference
  - Functional Programming Constructs
  - Operator Overloading

Another key thing to note is that not all valid C++ programs are C programs.
Even though C++ originally started out as a language that compiled to C, it is no longer the case.

Like C, C++ had a long period before it underwent a standardization process, and so the first version of the language is chronicled in the C++ programming language, by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985.

The first ANSI standard was published in 1998, and revised in 2003, so some people refer to these versions as C++98 and C++03 informally.
Revisions to the standard were made in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, and so these versions are called C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.
